# AutoInstaller

AutoInstaller is a lightweight utility to automatically download and install popular software usually aimed at gamers on Windows systems. It aims to streamline the software setup process for fresh installations or for those who regularly need to install gaming software.

This project was initially meant for private use, but I decided to make it public.

## Features:

1. **One-Click Installations** - Quickly install popular software without needing to navigate multiple websites.
2. **Concurrent Downloads** - The utility can handle multiple installations concurrently to speed up the process.
3. **Graphics Card Detection** - Automatically detects NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards and provides appropriate driver installations.
5. **Clean Interface** - The interface is kept as clean and minimalistic as possible.
6. **Efficient** - The program does not hog a lot of system resources.
